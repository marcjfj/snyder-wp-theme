## Converted the static site to a WP theme

It was great meeting you all today!

This theme is totally incomplete (I didn't plan on showing it to anyone). 

What I did:

- Break the layout into header.php, index.php, and footer.php
- Add some functions to functions.php to enqueue scripts and styles
- Converted the desktop navigation to a wordpress component (is that the right term?)
- started playing with ACF (I hear that's a go-to for agencies)

Overall I feel that have a decent feel for the underlying mechanics of WordPress.
